## Module Report
### Module Code: A01002
**Full Title:** Plants and Society
**Short Title:** Plants and Society
**Credits:** 5
**Level:** Intermediate
**Aim:** This module examines the importance of plants in modern society and tackles some of the increasingly complex issues that surround the biotechnology of plants. It is necessary for science students to understand these issues and to practice defending their informed opinions, the protocols used and also the plant science research that takes place during the development of new biotechnologies. Society increasingly looks to science graduates to bridge the gap in their understanding of novel biotechnology and this module will help science students to develop skills in evaluating news sources and debating, and ultimately, will produce graduates who will inform society and foster trust in the scientific process. This elective is offered to any science student in WIT who seeks to develop their knowledge of plant biotechnology, the importance of plants in society, and who wants to learn how to generate convincing arguments.

### Module Code: A01766
**Full Title:** Food Analysis
**Short Title:** Food Analysis
**Credits:** 5
**Level:** Introductory
**Aim:** Food analysis is an essential part of the agri-food industry, and encompasses the determination of nutritional value, compliance with labelling/legal requirements, assessment of product quality and detection of adulteration. The aim of this module is to introduce the student to the basic principles of analytical techniques commonly used to determine the chemical composition of foods. The module will provide the student with both theoretical and practical knowledge of techniques for the determination of macro- and micronutrients within foods. This module will equip students to work in food analysis across a broad range of agri-food industries in Ireland.

**Indicative Content:** Quantitative analysis of foods for moisture, lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals
Theory and practise of traditional wet chemistry techniques for food analysis
Principles and application of spectrophotometric methods, including UV-visible, fluorescence and atomic absorption
Principles and application of chromatographic methods in analysis, e.g. HPLC, GC

**Learning Outcomes:** Identify the compositional components of a variety of food products.
Discuss the principles of and procedures for standard methodologies in food analysis.
Compare different analytical methods used within the food industry.
Employ a range of food analytical techniques for a variety of food types.
Report on a range of food analytical techniques for a variety of food types.

**Assessment Criteria:** <40%: Little or no demonstration of an understanding of the fundamentals of the learning outcomes. Lack of competence with regards to use of associated laboratory skills, techniques and instrumentation.
40%-49%: Demonstrate understanding of the fundamentals of the learning outcomes. Will display some ability with regard to the use of associated laboratory skills, techniques and instrumentation.
50%-59%: Demonstrate satisfactory understanding of the fundamentals of the learning outcomes. Will display reasonable competence with regards to use of associated laboratory techniques instrumentation and good laboratory practice.

### Module Code: A14171
**Full Title:** Legal Principles of Computer Forensics
**Short Title:** Legal Prin of Comp Forensics
**Credits:** 5
**Level:** Introductory
**Aim:** This module aims to enable students to gain a detailed knowledge and understanding of the Irish Legal System along with a clear and concise account of the fundamental principles of computer forensics law. As part of their studies, students will gain a detailed knowledge and understanding of the general principles of many diverse areas of law that apply to computer forensics. Students will gain a detailed knowledge of Criminal Law, especially as it relates to Computer Forensics. The various computer based criminal offences pursuant to legislation will be analysed. This module will also aim to enable students to study and demonstrate competence in the relevant rules of evidence with particular emphasis on gathering electronic evidence. The use and admissibility of electronic evidence in proceedings. The legal responsibilities placed on forensic investigators during the conduct of their investigation. This module will also ensure that students may confidently handle, analyse and apply Domestic, English, EU and USA Law to Computer Forensics and enable students to evaluate the role of the law and legal policy to the dynamic and rapidly changing world of Computer Forensics.
